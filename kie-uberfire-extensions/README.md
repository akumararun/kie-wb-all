kie-uberfire-extensions
=======================

KIE extensions to UberFire framework.

Much of this has migrated to https://github.com/uberfire/uberfire-extensions so that it has its own release cycle (although tied to UberFire). This allows other projects, such as https://github.com/dashbuilder/dashbuilder,  to to re-use the features.

The remaining "Social Activities" modules are set to move to https://github.com/uberfire/uberfire-extensions however they contain a dependency on Drools at the moment and hence need to reside in the droolsjbpm "build group".
