Distribution Builder
==========================

The 'builder' project generates the product distribution for different applications servers.

Currently, the following artifacts are generated:

* **dashbuilder-jboss-as7.0.war:**

    Product distribution for JBoss 7.0 and JBoss 7.1 servers.
    By the default the distribution is configured to use H2 hibernate dialect and database drivers aren't packaged with the distribution.

    Read the [src/main/dashbuilder-jbossas7/README.md](https://github.com/droolsjbpm/dashboard-builder/blob/master/builder/src/main/jbossas7/README.md) file to get more information.
