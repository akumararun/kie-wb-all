            Answers can take a while. Wait at least an hour. If no one answers, then they are busy or AFK. Try the
            %a{:href => "forum.html"} forum
            instead.
          %li
            Don’t send private messages to anyone, use only the public channels. Private support is reserved for Red Hat customers only.
          %li
            No need to waste time by asking "Can I ask a question?". Just ask your question immediately.
          %li
            If you need assistance with other JBoss projects, try their IRC channel on Freenode.
