              %p For those who want to get straight to the point and start playing with the tooling from the minute 0 please read next how to install & run a demo installation in less than 5 minutes.
              %h3 Prerequisites
              %p The only prerequisite to run the demo application is to have the JDK 1.6+ installed in your machine.
              %p
                If you don't have the JDK 1.6 installed in your system please use the following
                %a{:href => "http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html", :target => "_blank"} download
                and follow
                the installation instructions. (go the "Java SE 6 Update XX" section to select the last available update).
              %h3 Installation steps
              %ul
                %li
                  Check your JDK installation:
                  %blockquote
                    Open a shell window a type the following command:
                    %br/
                    %code $ java -version
                %li
                  You should see an output like this:
                  %blockquote
                    "java version "1.6.0_35"
                    %br/
                    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_35-b10)
                    %br/
                    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.10-b01, mixed mode)"
                %li
                  Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable pointing to the JDK installation directory:
                  %blockquote
                    %code $ export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.6.0
                %li
                  Unzip the Dashbuilder demo zip file:
                  %blockquote
                    (
                    %a{:href => "http://downloads.jboss.org/dashbuilder/dashbuilder-demo.zip", :target => "_blank"}> http://downloads.jboss.org/dashbuilder/dashbuilder-demo.zip
                    ) to a given directory (the [target_directory]).
                    %br>/
                    You should get a directory structure like this:
                    %code
                      [target_directory]/dashbuilder-demo
                      %br/
                      README.md
                      %br/
                      start-demo.sh
                      %br/
                      start-demo.bat
                      %br/
                      realm.properties

                      \/db
                %li
                  Open a command window and execute the start-demo.sh script for linux or start-demo.bat for windows:
                  %blockquote
                    %code
                      $ cd
                      %target_directory
                        \/dashbuilder-demo
                        %br/
                        $ ./start-demo.sh
                    %br/
                    or
                    %br/
                    %code
                      C:\ cd
                      %target_directory
                        \\dashbuilder-demo
                        start-demo.bat
                    %br/
                    NOTE: The application uses an auto-deployable embedded H2 database which it's automatically created when you start
                    the app for the very first time. The database initialization procedure it takes a few minutes. Furthermore, you should
                    take into account that the H2 database downgrades the application performance compared with other databases like
                    PostgreSQL, MySQL, normally used in production environments.
                %li
                  Once the application is started, open a browser and type the URL:
                  %blockquote
                    %code http://localhost:8080/dashbuilder
                    = succeed "The" do
                      %br/
                    following user(s)/password(s) are available by default:
                    %br/
                    = succeed ":" do
                      %strong root/root
                    to sign-in as the superuser
                    %br/
                    = succeed ":" do
                      %strong demo/demo
                    to sign-in as an end user
                    %br>/
                    On start-up, the application installs automatically some ready-to-use sample dashboards, for demo and learning purposes.
                    %br/
                    \.
                %li To stop the application close the terminal window or type the "Ctrl + C" command.
              %h3 Application database
              %p The demo application database will be generated automatically when you start the application for the first time.
              %p
                If you want to restore the application to its initial state you can:
              %ol
                %li Stop the application (if running).
                %li
                  Delete the database files in the
                  %code /db
                  directory.
                %li Start the application.
