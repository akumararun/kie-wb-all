<p>Follow the instructions of Awestruct's <a href="http://awestruct.org/getting_started/">getting started guide</a>.</p>

<p>First set up your environment correctly:</p>

<pre><code>$ curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby=1.9.3
$ gem install awestruct bundler
$ rake setup
</code></pre>

<p>Then build the website (before and after your changes):</p>

<pre><code>$ rake clean build
$ firefox _site/index.html
</code></pre>

<p>And publish your changes:</p>

<pre><code>$ rake publish

Note: this doesn't work, use `./build.sh publish` instead.
</code></pre>
