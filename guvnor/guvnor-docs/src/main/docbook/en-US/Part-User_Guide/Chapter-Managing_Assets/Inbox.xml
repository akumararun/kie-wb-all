  <title>Inbox and comments</title>

  <para>Built into the Guvnor are two useful features to helping manage
  changes: an Inbox, and a comments section. These features do not affect any
  execution or access to rules, but are purely for documentation and
  notification purposes, and are of course always optional to use.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Inbox</title>

    <para>In the "browse" section of the application, there is an "Inbox" tree
    item, below this are 3 inboxes. "Incoming changes" contains changes to any
    artifacts that the current logged in user has edited in the past, or
    commented on. Simply editing or commenting on an artifact registers
    interest in it to be notified of changes the next time you log
    in."Recently opened" contains items that have been recently opened (simply
    opening an artifact will make it appear here, the last 100 recently opened
    items will appear here). "Recently edited" contains the last 100 recently
    edited items (artifacts that the current user has made changes to).</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Comments</title>

    <para>Below the documentation box of each artifact, is a "comments"
    section - simply, you can add a new comment. Administrators can clear all
    comments on a given artifact, but other users can only append comments.
    Each comment records what user made the comment, and when. Users who can't
    edit artifacts can still comment on them.</para>
