  <title>The business user perspective</title>

  <para>
  You can see from this manual, that some expertise and practice is required to use Guvnor. In fact any
  software system in some sense requires that people be "technical" even if it has a nice looking GUI. Having
  said that, in the right hands Guvnor can be setup to provide a suitable environment for non technical users.
  </para>

  <para>
  The most appropriate rule formats for this use are using the Guided editor, Decision tables and DSL rules.
  You can use some DSL expressions also in the guided editor (so it provides "forms" for people to enter
  values).
  </para>

  <para>
  You can use categories to isolate rules and assets from non technical users. Only assets which have a
  category assigned will appear in the "categories" view.
  </para>

  <para>
  The initial setup of Guvnor will need to be done by a developer/technical person who will set the
  foundations for all the rules. They may also create "templates" which are rules which may be copied (they
  would typically live in a "dummy" package, and have a category of "template" - this can also help ease the
  way).
  </para>

  <para>
  Deployment should also not be done by non technical users (as mentioned previously this happens from the
  "Package" feature).
