  <title>Creating a business user view</title>

  <para>
  In most cases not all users will want to see all the functionality described here. You could have a subset
  of users who you only want to let view or edit certain sets of rules, without getting confused by all the
  other stuff. In this case you can use fine grained authorization (see the Admin Guide on how to initialize
  this). By setting permissions on a per category basis, users that only have category permissions will see a
  limited subset of functionality, and only items that are tagged with those categories.
