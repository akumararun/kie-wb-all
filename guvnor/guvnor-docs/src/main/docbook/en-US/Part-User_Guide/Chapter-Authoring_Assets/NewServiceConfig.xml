  <title>Services</title>

  <para>
    Service Config is a special asset that defines an execution
    service configuration. This execution service is a war file (generated
    automatically by the editor) which you can deploy to execute KnowledgeBases
    remotely for any sort of client application. As this service is stateless,
    it is possible to have as many of these services deployed as you need to
    serve the client load.
  </para>

  <para>
    This version of the execution server supports as many Knowledge Bases
    as you need, supporting also multiple stateless and statefull sessions
    in a native way.
  </para>

  <para>
    To create a new Service you have to go to "Create New" -> "New Service Config"
    option in Knowledge Base section of Guvnor.  In the following sections you have
    detailed information on howto configure your Service Config.

    <title>Downloading War &amp; Managing Dependencies</title>

    <para>After configuring your knowledge bases and sessions, you're ready to download
      the service war. For so, all you need to do is click on the "Download War" button and
      the following screen (or a similar one, depending on your browser) will show up.
    </para>

        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
    </figure>

    <warning>
      <para>Before click on the "Download War" button, makes sure that you don't
        have pending changes. This is a very important step, once the the war file
        is generated based on the latest saved information and not on the current
        screen state.
      </para>
    </warning>

    <para>
      The generated file is a ready to be deployed war file. Which mean that it contains all
      the necessary configuration files and all the needed dependencies as well. As dependency
      management is a crucial subject in a real world applications deployment, we will discuss
      that in more detail in the next section.
    </para>

    <section>
      <title>Dependency Management</title>

      <para>As already mentioned, the generated war file contains all the necessary dependencies
        to execute the configured Service, it works seamlessly on most standard containers.
      </para>

      <para>But the reality is a bit different, rarelly you'll have a "standard container",
        usually what you have is an already configured and running container. Probably this
        container even have already configured a set of shared libs between your deployed
        application. And, of course, you don't want those shared libs on your wars.
      </para>

      <para>Based on real world scenarios, we made availabe a simple dependency management
        tool, that enables you explore and configure all the dependencies containted in
        the generated war file. This tool can be accessed just by clicking the "Manage Dependencies"
        button, and the following dialog will be displayed.
      </para>

        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>
        This dialog presents the complete dependency tree of the service. To disable any
        particular dependency, all you need to do is "uncheck" it and press the "OK" button.
      </para>

      <para>
        Important to note that after configuring your dependencies you have to save the
        service configuration, in order to have the generated war file reflecting your
        configuration.
