  <title>Version management</title>

  <para>Both assets and whole packages of assets are "versioned" in the
  Guvnor, but the mechanism is slightly different. Individual assets are saved
  a bit like a version of a file in a source control system. However, packages
  of assets are versioned "on demand" by taking a snapshot (typically which is
  used for deployment). The next section talks about deployment management and
  snapshots.</para>

  <para>Each time you make a change to an asset, it creates a new item in the
  version history. This is a bit like having an unlimited undo. You can look
  back through the history of an individual asset like the list above, and
  view it (and restore it) from that point in time.</para>
