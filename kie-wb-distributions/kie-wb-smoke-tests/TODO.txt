KIE Workbench and KIE Drools Workbench Smoke Tests - TODO list
==============================================================
 - setup cargo to use random network ports to avoid port collisions
     - different containers are using additional ports (e.g. Tomcat for AJP connector, EAP/WildFly for admin. access), this needs to be considered
     - build-helper-maven-plugin can used

 - add cargo config + profile for WildFly

 - add cargo config + profile for JBossAS 7 (is this still needed?)

 - apply the XSLT templates to container config. In ideal case this could be done as a part of cargo execution. However, it would probably need to
   be implemented, as the feature is not there right now
     - properly setup JMS for EAP and WildFly using the XSLT and un-ignore the JMS tests
     - use the XSLT to setup Tomcat's Valve, instead of copying the whole server.xml

 - add few most basic UI tests (e.g. just login/logout + click through the menus)

 - configure workbench to use custom maven setttings.xml to avoid installing to local (~/.m2) maven repo

 - create simple README that would sum up the tests being executed + some basic conventions for adding new tests, updating cargo config, adding additional profiles, etc

 - the smoke tests are still very much work in progress, they need polishing, refactorings, etc
