${symbol_pound} This is a marker file. When it is detected inside a JAR or at the
${symbol_pound} top of any classpath, the subdirectories are scanned for deployable
${symbol_pound} components. As such, all Errai application modules in a project
${symbol_pound} should contain an ErraiApp.properties at the root of all classpaths
${symbol_pound} that you wish to be scanned.
${symbol_pound}
${symbol_pound} There are also some configuration options that can be set in this
${symbol_pound} file, although it is rarely necessary. See the documentation at
${symbol_pound} https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/ERRAI/ErraiApp.properties
${symbol_pound} for details.
