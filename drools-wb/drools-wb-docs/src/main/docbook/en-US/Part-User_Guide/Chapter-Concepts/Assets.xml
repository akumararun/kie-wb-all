  <title>Rules are assets</title>

  <para>As the Guvnor can manage many different types of rules (and more),
  they are all classed as "assets". An asset is anything that can be stored as
  a version in the repository. This includes decision tables, models, DSLs and
  more. Sometimes the word "rule" will be used to really mean "asset" (i.e.
  the things you can do also apply to the other asset types). You can think of
  asset as a lot like a file in a folder. Assets are grouped together for
  viewing, or to make a package for deployment etc.</para>
