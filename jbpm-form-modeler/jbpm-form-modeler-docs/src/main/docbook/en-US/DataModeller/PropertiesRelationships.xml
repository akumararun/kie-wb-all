  <para>Once the data entity has been created, it now has to be completed by
  adding user-defined properties to its definition. This can be achieved by
  providing the required information in the "Create new field" section (see
  fig. "New attribute creation"), and clicking on the "Create" button when
  finished. The following fields can (or must) be filled out:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>The attribute's internal identifier (mandatory). The value of this
      field must be unique per data entity, i.e. if the proposed identifier
      already exists within current entity, an error message will be
      displayed.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>A label (optional): as with the entity definition, the user can
      define a user-friendly label for the data entity attribute which is
      about to be created. This has no further implications on how attributes
      from objects of this entity will be treated. If a label is defined, then
      this is how the attribute will be displayed throughout the data modeller
      tool.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>An attribute type (mandatory): each entity attribute needs to be
      assigned with a type.</para>

      <para>This type can be either of the following:</para>

      <para/>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>A 'primitive' type: these include most of the object
          equivalents of the standard Java primitive types, such as Boolean,
          Short, Float, etc, as well as String, Date, BigDecimal and
          BigInteger.</para>

          <para/>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>An 'entity' type: any user defined entity automatically
          becomes a candidate to be defined as an attribute type of another
          entity, thus enabling the creation of relationships between
          entities. As can be observed in the above figure, our recently
          defined 'Tutorial Example Entity' already appears in the types list
          and can be used as an attribute type, even for an attribute of
          itself. An entity type attribute can be created either in 'single'
          or in 'multiple' form, the latter implying that the attribute will
          be defined as a collection of this type, which will be indicated by
          the extension '[0..N]' in the type drop-down or in the entity
          attributes table (as can be seen for the 'Lines' attribute of the
          'Purchase Order' entity, for example).</para>

  <para>When finished introducing the initial information for a new attribute,
  clicking the 'Create' button will add the newly created attribute to the end
  of the entity's attributes table below:</para>

    <title>New attribute has been created</title>

      </mediaobject>
    </screenshot>
  </figure>

  <para/>

  <para>The new attribute will also automatically be selected in the entity's
  attribute list, and its properties will be shown in the Field tab of the
  Property editor. The latter facilitates completion of some additional
  properties of the new attribute by the user (see below).</para>

  <para>At any time, any attribute (without restrictions) can be deleted from
  an entity definition by clicking on the corresponding 'x' icon in the
  entity's attributes table.</para>
